      <h3>Homemade Raspberry Pi Security camera</h3>
      <p>Here I installed a program for the raspberry pi operating system which is powered by OpenCV to detect objects in view of the camera. OpenCV is a programming library used for real-time computer vision, OpenCV comprises of object detection, face recognition and machine learning for applications to accelerate the use of machine perception in commerical products. </p>
      <p>This was a very fun home made project to do in my spare time as I was able to freely experiment with how I want the camera to detect objects. For instance, I gave it an option to always send a email with a photo attachment every hour and left it infont of my garden window. It resulted in quite a lot of intresting photos of birds, insects and nature.</p>
